This file contains all of my notes around the work for CHAIN and E-CHAIM.
This will contain a work log as well as todo items that need to be tracked.

* [2020-07-10 Fri]
** Moved my todo list to my planner. Too hard to track here. This will only be for notes.

* [2020-07-09 Thu]
** Had to reinstall Linux on my laptop.
** Finished the idl nrlmsise library and sent it to Anthony and David.

* [2020-07-07 Tue]
** :NOTE: For IDL, use the license server lic.chain-project.net:7070

* [2020-07-06 Mon]
** DONE Build Linux version of the IDL NRLM MSIS code.
   CLOSED: [2020-07-09 Thu 13:28]
*** Sent a version to Bion Larson. It seems to be working now. Alse just sent it to Anthony and David.
*** Sent this to Anthony and David. David said to include it in the repo, so this is closed.
** DONE Update php on chain-new
   CLOSED: [2020-07-10 Fri 11:17] SCHEDULED: <2020-07-11 Sat>
https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-install-or-upgrade-to-php-7-on-centos-linux-server

* [2020-07-03 Fri]
** DONE Talk with David and Anthony about Linux versions of the nrlm dll and mex file.
   CLOSED: [2020-07-07 Tue 11:15]
   Talked to them. It turns out that there was no Linux version. Added to my todo list.

* [2020-07-02 Thu]
** Yesterday was Canada Day
** Morning was spent getting groceries, etc.
** DONE Add a validation check on the ECHAIM web app to make sure single value inputs only have a single value. Looked into this in more detail. This is not the source of the sigabrt errors.
   CLOSED: [2020-07-02 Thu 15:04]
** DONE Look into the download issue for Shayan
   CLOSED: [2020-07-06 Mon 10:37]
// server side
router.get("/download/:fileName", (req, res) => {
   const fileName = req.params.fileName;
   res.download(`./userSettings/${fileName}.json`);
});
// client side
const downloadMode = async (target) => {
   const row = $(target).closest("tr");
   const name = row.find("td:lt(2)").text().trim();
   // send GET request to the server with the given name
   await axios(`/modes/download/${name}`);
   // console.log(res);
   // $(target).attr("href", `/modes/download/${name}`);
};
   I sent Shayan notes about using the pipe method. Not sure if it will work, but he can try it out.
** DONE Diagnose the sigabrt errors around the ECHAIM web app.

*** The crashes all seem to be on the electron density page, and all from the same IP address (129.241.49.189)
*** Found that this was happening for dates earlier than 2011. Specifically, this user was trying to do runs for 2010. Sent to Anthony to verify.

* [2020-06-30 Tue]
** Archived all entries previous to 2020
** Fixed some emacs initialization stuff.

** DONE Break up apache logging into separate files to make chain-new more debuggable
   CLOSED: [2020-07-03 Fri 16:15]
*** Added the following log format strings
LogFormat "%v %h %l %u %t %m \"%r\" %f %>s %b" vhost_common
CustomLog "logs/filename" vhost_common
   I sent an email to Richard telling him that I did a first pass on breaking up the logging.

   CLOSED: [2020-07-10 Fri 11:10]
** DONE Moving my work notes back to an electronic version. I had been working on paper, but for work and for calendaring, I am moving back to electronic versions.
   CLOSED: [2020-06-30 Tue 10:28]
** Working from campus. This is my second Monday.
** DONE Need to update my work stuff and my calendar stuff when I get home.
   CLOSED: [2020-06-30 Tue 10:28]
** DONE Update Matlab Release on the web site.
   CLOSED: [2020-06-30 Tue 13:42]
*** Waiting for Anthony to get back about whether we need a new version number.
*** <2020-06-29 Mon> Anthony got back to me. There is a new version number tagged.
* [2020-02-04 Tue]
** Continued development of the R-CHAIM API
   I added some logic that returns a list of files in the current working directory.
   The API can now return a file from the current directory when given the filename.

* [2020-01-28 Tue]
** Cleaning up getpocket list
** Spent the morning at home
** SSH over ADB :NOTES:
   We can use and ADB connection over USB to SSH into an Android device.  You need to install adb with
      sudo apt-get install adb
   Then you can create a port forward rule
      adb forward tcp:8022 tcp:8022
   This forwards the local port 8022 to the port 8022 on Android. This is because SSH on termux listens on 8022 by default.
   You can now connect using
      ssh localhost -p 8022

* [2020-01-24 Fri]
** Added some checks to the model_file.php download function to verify that the file exists and is readable.
** Weekly meeting

* [2020-01-23 Thu]
** Got a basic server set up to listen for requests. Need to define the API.
** Richard is back from being out sick.
** Starting the RCHAIM API for making requests.

* [2020-01-21 Tue]
** Pushed an updated version of the CHAIM Matlab package to the web site.
** Cut down the data management plan for the GO Canada AO proposal to the 3 page maximum that we have
** Yesterday was mostly reading

* [2020-01-16 Thu]
** Mentored Shayan and provided some direction in fixing the authentication part of the web site.
** Finished the initial S4 analysis. Have a number of candidates to review.
** DONE Update github
** DONE Update php
** DONE Update chain-new
** DONE chain-new.physics.unb.ca doesn't seem to resolve quite correctly.
** DONE Rescue boot for sites [100%]
   We need a way to ensure that we can always get into the remote sites. The idea is to have a USB key that can be booted and provide access to the machine.
*** DONE Look at Churchill as one of the oldest remote sites and use that as the base to plan for. Everything else should work more easily.
*** DONE Create a test VM to work with.
*** DONE Create a tinycore or MXLinux image that has all of the tools we need.

* [2020-01-15 Wed]
** Sent in a bio and CV to Chris to be included in the AO grant proposal.
** Did more S$ analysis. Almost done.

* [2020-01-14 Tue]
** Did a first pass on our part of the AO proposal. Still need to cut most of a page out of it.
** Started looking for S4 jumps. Between 1/3 and 1/2 done the first pass.
** Talked to Abdelhaq about the plasma physics class. I will still attend, but not for credit.

* [2020-01-13 Mon]
** Moved my github hosted blog to using Nikola. The initial post is up and running.
** Richard is out, not feeling well.
** DONE Add checks into the file download php file, make it more robust.

* [2020-01-10 Fri]
** Weekly meeting
   Aaron gave a talk on modeling the transmit antenna on the CADI.
** Helping Shayan
   Shayan had a git problem. He somehow created a file that had backslashes as part of the file name. This means that when he tried to do a checkout on a Windows box, it fails. I deleted the file in question and pushed it back up to gitlab. It now works.

* [2020-01-09 Thu]
** Made several changes to the CHAIM section of chain-new:
*** Removed the model files from the supplementary software section, since they already existed on the A-CHAIM side.
*** Added a "rules of the Road" section to each of the introductory sections of the CHAIM side of the web site.
*** Created a php file to manage downloading the single model file that a client is interested in. It takes the run time, subtracts 2 hours and adds 52 minutes and downloads the file that matches that time

* [2020-01-08 Wed]
** Added the "Rules of the Road" to the introductory pages for each section on the CHAIM web site.
** Removed the A-CHAIM model output files from the E-CHAIM supplementary section, since it is already in the A-CHAIM section.
** Reorganized the ISMR data files so that they are broken up by location. Now to parse out the pieces I need.
** Filtering out the data needed for S4 analysis using
    ls | xargs -i{} gunzip -c {} | cut -f1,2,3,5,6,8,9 -d',' >>../arc_2015_S4.csv
where the fields are
    1 - Week Number
    2 - Time Of Week
    3 - SVID
    5 - Azimuth
    6 - Elevation
    8 - Total S4 on Sig1
    9 - Correction to S4

* [2020-01-07 Tue]
** Updated Win10 partition on work hard drive.

* [2020-01-06 Mon]
** Richard noticed that file expansion in bash was working weirdly. When he tried to do an ls with the range [a-f], he was also getting some upper case values. It looks like the en_US locale gives aAbBcCdDeEf as the range. In order to get abcdef as the range, need to set LC_COLLATE as either C or POSIX.
** DONE Meet with Aaron, Anton and Shayan
   SCHEDULED: <2020-01-08 Wed 11:30>
** Just recompiled the C version of the echaim binary for the web site. The command used is   :NOTE:
    gcc -o echaim *.c -std=c99 -lm -pthread -ldl -lcurl
** Anthony notified us that the new version of the CHAIM software is now available and using the new AACGM. Need to update what is offered on the web site.
** Richard is continuing his issue with ITS around what they are blocking/allowing through their firewall and in to our systems.
** Richard noticed that there were 408 status codes from the chain-new web server. After searching Google, it looks like the most likely case is that the client browser is keeping an unused connection open that the browser decides to close with a 408 code.

* [2020-01-03 Fri]
** Got an email from Anthony. Apparently AACGM got updated January 1 so that the old version no longer works. Anthony is currently updating the ECHAIM software.
** Updated the achaim globe plots to use UTC time in the plot title.

* [2020-01-02 Thu]
** Encrypted Storage  :NOTE:
    There is an encrypted file in the storage subdirectory. You can unencrypt it with the following command
        openssl enc -d -aes256 -in secured.tar.gz | tar xvz
    If you have to reencrypt, you can use the following command
        tar czf - * | openssl enc -e -aes256 -out secured.tar.gz
** Moved the work desktop to Cinnamon. I think this is a good mix between Gnome 3 and KDE, without too much of either one.
** Back to work after Christmas break
** Apparently, there are people from China downloading historical DB files for ECHAIM. Richard noticed, and had to block one particular IP address due to bandwidth issues.
** DONE Talk to David about what to do about historical DB ECHAIM files.
** Plymouth changes  :NOTE:
    To change the plymouth theme, use
        sudo update-alternatives --config default.plymouth
    Then you can set it with the command
        sudo update-initramfs -u
