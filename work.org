This file contains all of my notes around the work for CHAIN and E-CHAIM.
This will contain a work log as well as todo items that need to be tracked.

* [2020-01-10 Fri]
** Weekly meeting
   Aaron gave a talk on modeling the transmit antenna on the CADI.
** Helping Shayan
   Shayan had a git problem. He somehow created a file that had backslashes as part of the file name. This means that when he tried to do a checkout on a Windows box, it fails. I deleted the file in question and pushed it back up to gitlab. It now works.

* [2020-01-09 Thu]
** Made several changes to the CHAIM section of chain-new:
*** Removed the model files from the supplementary software section, since they already existed on the A-CHAIM side.
*** Added a "rules of the Road" section to each of the introductory sections of the CHAIM side of the web site.
*** Created a php file to manage downloading the single model file that a client is interested in. It takes the run time, subtracts 2 hours and adds 52 minutes and downloads the file that matches that time

* [2020-01-08 Wed]
** Added the "Rules of the Road" to the introductory pages for each section on the CHAIM web site.
** Removed the A-CHAIM model output files from the E-CHAIM supplementary section, since it is already in the A-CHAIM section.
** Reorganized the ISMR data files so that they are broken up by location. Now to parse out the pieces I need.
** Filtering out the data needed for S4 analysis using
    ls | xargs -i{} gunzip -c {} | cut -f1,2,3,5,6,8,9 -d',' >>../arc_2015_S4.csv
where the fields are
    1 - Week Number
    2 - Time Of Week
    3 - SVID
    5 - Azimuth
    6 - Elevation
    8 - Total S4 on Sig1
    9 - Correction to S4

* [2020-01-07 Tue]
** Updated Win10 partition on work hard drive.

* [2020-01-06 Mon]
** Richard noticed that file expansion in bash was working weirdly. When he tried to do an ls with the range [a-f], he was also getting some upper case values. It looks like the en_US locale gives aAbBcCdDeEf as the range. In order to get abcdef as the range, need to set LC_COLLATE as either C or POSIX.
** DONE Meet with Aaron, Anton and Shayan
   SCHEDULED: <2020-01-08 Wed 11:30>
** Just recompiled the C version of the echaim binary for the web site. The command used is   :NOTE:
    gcc -o echaim *.c -std=c99 -lm -pthread -ldl -lcurl
** Anthony notified us that the new version of the CHAIM software is now available and using the new AACGM. Need to update what is offered on the web site.
** Richard is continuing his issue with ITS around what they are blocking/allowing through their firewall and in to our systems.
** Richard noticed that there were 408 status codes from the chain-new web server. After searching Google, it looks like the most likely case is that the client browser is keeping an unused connection open that the browser decides to close with a 408 code.

* [2020-01-03 Fri]
** Got an email from Anthony. Apparently AACGM got updated January 1 so that the old version no longer works. Anthony is currently updating the ECHAIM software.
** Updated the achaim globe plots to use UTC time in the plot title.

* [2020-01-02 Thu]
** Encrypted Storage  :NOTE:
    There is an encrypted file in the storage subdirectory. You can unencrypt it with the following command
        openssl enc -d -aes256 -in secured.tar.gz | tar xvz
    If you have to reencrypt, you can use the following command
        tar czf - * | openssl enc -e -aes256 -out secured.tar.gz
** Moved the work desktop to Cinnamon. I think this is a good mix between Gnome 3 and KDE, without too much of either one.
** Back to work after Christmas break
** Apparently, there are people from China downloading historical DB files for ECHAIM. Richard noticed, and had to block one particular IP address due to bandwidth issues.
** TODO Talk to David about what to do about historical DB ECHAIM files.
** Plymouth changes  :NOTE:
    To change the plymouth theme, use
        sudo update-alternatives --config default.plymouth
    Then you can set it with the command
        sudo update-initramfs -u

* [2020-01-01 Wed]
** Doing a system sync                                                 :NOTE:
   mkdir .myconfig
   mkdir repos
   echo ".myconfig" >>.gitignore
   git clone --bare https://github.com/joeybernard/myconfig.git $HOME/.myconfig
   alias config='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.myconfig --work-tree=$HOME'
   config checkout
** Cadence Licensing   :NOTE:
   To check license on chain-new
      cd /opt/cadence/LCU
      ./tools.lnx86/bin/lmutil lmstat -c license.dat -a
   To check in a locked license
      ./tools.lnx86/bin/lmutil lmremove -c license.dat Or_CAD_Designer_Basics c3b27 FR-PHY-35484 0:0

* [2018-09-12 Wed]
** Sent new E-CHAIM user account info to David.
** Blocked users Sara, Gowher and Shiva on gitlab.
** Changed Edward and Anton so that they are no longer external in gitlab.
** Anthony noticed that I had a typo in his auto_db script. He fixed it.

* [2018-09-11 Tue]
** Worked from home in order to let the flooring guys into the house.
** Sent a list of the currently registered users of the E-CHAIM web site to David. There are only two.
** Added version 1.0.1 of the C code to the web site.

** Gave the travel reimbursement form to Todd for Rankin Inlet.
** Closed a bunch of todo items

* [2018-09-06 Thu]
** Checked the January 1 2011 date that caused problems earlier. This seems to work now.
** Paperwork for cash advance for Qikiqtarjuaq and Sachs Harbour was sent in.
** DONE Need to fix the SSL certs on chain-new so that we have just a single cert for both domain names.
** DONE In the Lat-Alt contour plot, the Lat is not counting correctly. It goes forever.
   CLOSED: [2018-09-07 Fri 12:50]
** DONE Redo the contour plots to be just 2D view maps.
   CLOSED: [2018-09-07 Fri 13:17]
** DONE Change any plots that have altitudes to put the altitudes on the Y axis.
   CLOSED: [2018-09-07 Fri 13:17]

   CLOSED: [2018-09-07 Fri 12:44]
** DONE Resize the plots to fit in the Y-axis label
   CLOSED: [2018-09-07 Fri 13:18]
*** Since these are now all 2D, the label manipulation happened automatically.

* [2018-09-05 Wed]
** Applied the command
    git config --global http.sslVerify false
   to my work machine.

** Had to disable selinux on the compute machine.
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     sudo setenforce Permissive
   #+END_SRC
*** Then edited /etc/sysconfig/selinux and set "SELINUX=disabled"

* [2018-09-04 Tue]
** DONE Create a data file that generates the problem in January 1 2011 :ECHAIM:
   CLOSED: [2018-09-06 Thu 08:27]
*** [2018-09-06 Thu] Tried to rerun the problem date. It seems to work OK now. Maybe the new version of the ECHAIM C code fixed this issue?

** DONE There is an issue with forwarding SSL connections from apache through to gitlab when using "git clone"
   CLOSED: [2018-09-04 Tue 22:59]
*** Changed the certificate entry in /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf to use fullchain.pem.
    Will restart httpd tonight to see if this fixes the SSL problem.
    This did not work. Can't find a complete solution.
*** Just tell git not to verify the SSL certs with the command
    git config --global http.sslVerify false

** DONE Compiled a new version of echaim, using the release version. Copied the file ECHAIM.c into the lib directory, then used the following to compile: :ECHAIM:
   CLOSED: [2018-09-04 Tue 13:32]
   gcc -o echaim *.c -std=c99 -lm -pthread -ldl

** DONE Redo the output list and file to use the same file format as that used by gnuplot. :ECHAIM:
   CLOSED: [2018-09-06 Thu 10:33]

* [2018-09-03 Mon]
** DONE Create a cron job to pull the latest E-CHAIM DB to chain-new :ECHAIM:
   CLOSED: [2018-09-06 Thu 14:55]
*** The script needs to keep a date stamped version of the older DBs
*** The files are CHAIM_DB.db and MATLAB_DB.mat in /var/www/html/joomla/echaim_downloads
*** The new files on chain-cs1.chain-project.net
      /home2/amccaffr/ECHAIM_DB/CHAIM_DB.db
      /home2/amccaffr/ECHAIM_DB/CSV/MATLAB_DB.mat
*** Edited the file /home2/ammcaffr/ECHAIM_DB/autodb.sh so that it would copy the new database files to /home/jbernard/DB
*** Created the script db_update.sh and it is in the bin subdirectory for the root user. I copied in the private key into the .ssh subdirectory so that it can scp from jbernard@chain-cs1.chain-project.net. 
*** Created a cron job that does the following:
      10 7 * * * ~/bin/db_update.sh >>~/log/db_update.log 1>&2

** DONE Create a start script for apache and mariadb on chain-new    :ECHAIM:
