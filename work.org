This file contains all of my notes around the work for CHAIN and E-CHAIM.
This will contain a work log as well as todo items that need to be tracked.

* <2018-09-12 Wed>
** Sent new E-CHAIM user account info to David.
** Blocked users Sara, Gowher and Shiva on gitlab.
** Changed Edward and Anton so that they are no longer external in gitlab.
** Anthony noticed that I had a typo in his auto_db script. He fixed it.

* <2018-09-11 Tue>
** Worked from home in order to let the flooring guys into the house.
** Sent a list of the currently registered users of the E-CHAIM web site to David. There are only two.
** Added version 1.0.1 of the C code to the web site.
** Compiled version 1.0.1 to be used by the web app.
** TODO Need to add logging to track username, version and date for all downloads.

* <2018-09-10 Mon>
** Entered all of my flight info into the calendar.
** Added a software archive section on the E-CHAIM website. Also updated the version of the Matlab code.

* <2018-09-07 Fri>
** Gave the travel reimbursement form to Todd for Rankin Inlet.
** Closed a bunch of todo items

* <2018-09-06 Thu>
** Checked the January 1 2011 date that caused problems earlier. This seems to work now.
** Paperwork for cash advance for Qikiqtarjuaq and Sachs Harbour was sent in.
** TODO Need to fix the SSL certs on chain-new so that we have just a single cert for both domain names.
** DONE In the Lat-Alt contour plot, the Lat is not counting correctly. It goes forever.
   CLOSED: [2018-09-07 Fri 12:50]
** DONE Redo the contour plots to be just 2D view maps.
   CLOSED: [2018-09-07 Fri 13:17]
** DONE Change any plots that have altitudes to put the altitudes on the Y axis.
   CLOSED: [2018-09-07 Fri 13:17]
** DONE Remove the next prev buttons at the bottom of the E-CHAIM windows
   CLOSED: [2018-09-07 Fri 12:44]
** DONE Resize the plots to fit in the Y-axis label
   CLOSED: [2018-09-07 Fri 13:18]
*** Since these are now all 2D, the label manipulation happened automatically.

* <2018-09-05 Wed>
** Applied the command
    git config --global http.sslVerify false
   to my work machine.

** Had to disable selinux on the compute machine.
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     sudo setenforce Permissive
   #+END_SRC
*** Then edited /etc/sysconfig/selinux and set "SELINUX=disabled"

* <2018-09-04 Tue>
** DONE Create a data file that generates the problem in January 1 2011 :ECHAIM:
   CLOSED: [2018-09-06 Thu 08:27]
*** <2018-09-06 Thu> Tried to rerun the problem date. It seems to work OK now. Maybe the new version of the ECHAIM C code fixed this issue?

** DONE There is an issue with forwarding SSL connections from apache through to gitlab when using "git clone"
   CLOSED: [2018-09-04 Tue 22:59]
*** Changed the certificate entry in /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf to use fullchain.pem.
    Will restart httpd tonight to see if this fixes the SSL problem.
    This did not work. Can't find a complete solution.
*** Just tell git not to verify the SSL certs with the command
    git config --global http.sslVerify false

** DONE Compiled a new version of echaim, using the release version. Copied the file ECHAIM.c into the lib directory, then used the following to compile: :ECHAIM:
   CLOSED: [2018-09-04 Tue 13:32]
   gcc -o echaim *.c -std=c99 -lm -pthread -ldl

** DONE Redo the output list and file to use the same file format as that used by gnuplot. :ECHAIM:
   CLOSED: [2018-09-06 Thu 10:33]

* <2018-09-03 Mon>
** DONE Create a cron job to pull the latest E-CHAIM DB to chain-new :ECHAIM:
   CLOSED: [2018-09-06 Thu 14:55]
*** The script needs to keep a date stamped version of the older DBs
*** The files are CHAIM_DB.db and MATLAB_DB.mat in /var/www/html/joomla/echaim_downloads
*** The new files on chain-cs1.chain-project.net
      /home2/amccaffr/ECHAIM_DB/CHAIM_DB.db
      /home2/amccaffr/ECHAIM_DB/CSV/MATLAB_DB.mat
*** Edited the file /home2/ammcaffr/ECHAIM_DB/autodb.sh so that it would copy the new database files to /home/jbernard/DB
*** Created the script db_update.sh and it is in the bin subdirectory for the root user. I copied in the private key into the .ssh subdirectory so that it can scp from jbernard@chain-cs1.chain-project.net. 
*** Created a cron job that does the following:
      10 7 * * * ~/bin/db_update.sh >>~/log/db_update.log 1>&2

** TODO Create a start script for apache and mariadb on chain-new    :ECHAIM:
** DONE Rdesign gnuplot script for E-CHAIM web application	     :ECHAIM:
